#Outlook

- Dynamic Graphs
- GraphStream
- The Event Model
- Algorithms
- Visualisation
- Interaction with other tools
- Demos
    * basic demos
    * simulation of a mobile ad hoc network  


#First, static graphs
## Structure:{data-xx="ok"}

- Nodes, Vertices
- (undirected) Edges, Links
- (directed) Arcs

##Algorithms: Graphs Theory

- graph colouring problems
- routing problems
- flow problems
- covering problems
- subgraphs problems



# When we add dynamics...

## What kind of dynamics?

- values/weight on edges or nodes?
- nodes and/or edges added/removed?

## Problem with algorithms

- As soon as it gets computed, the result has vanished.
- Can we stop the graph and recompute?
- Depends on the dynamic graph model.
